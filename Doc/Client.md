# Brass Razoo Client

The Brass Razoo Client, will probably be developed with [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) so that it can be provided as an Android and iOS app, as well as hopefully a desktop app for Mac, Windows & Linux.

## QR Codes

The intention is the client will generate QR codes for records, if you want to request payment from someone, you would fill in the details of the record, show the QR Code to the buyer, they would then use the camera on their device to scan the QR Code which would load the record on their device, they would then pay/confirm/complete the record and you'll both be able to see the finalised record in your record list and any relevant funds transferred.
