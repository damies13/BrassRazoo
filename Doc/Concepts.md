# Concepts

## Proof of Stake

Bitcoin and Etherium are proof of work coins, these become very cpu / gpu intensive as the work algorithm becomes more difficult, there are many people criticising proof of work coins for their environmental impact and their lack of sustainability
BrassRazoo is more like Etherium2 it's a proof of stake coin, people buy coins, stake them with a server and a server with a stake is selected to create the next block. this model can run for a long time with each server only using a few watts an hour or even a few watts a day if a power efficient computer is used, e.g. a small Rasberry Pi with a battery and small solar panel should be able to run BrassRazoo, that's my aim


## Records

A record can be anything, i.e. a sale, an employment contract, a user account, the creation of a piece of art, a rule, etc

There will be rules to verify each type of record, the intention is the rules get created and voted on in the chain, when voted into operation then the rules will verify and enforce the records are created correctly.
