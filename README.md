# Brass Razoo (BRZ)

The Brass Razoo (BRZ) is a block chain crypto currency written in python named after the slang term [_I haven't got a brass razoo_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass_razoo)

As such the Brass Razoo block chain intentionally has a very minimal value, however it will be a stable coin of sorts, unlike other stable coins it's not pegged to a specific currency, but rather it's nominal value will be pegged to the value of [brass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass). A mineral coin if you like.

1 BRZ = 1 gram of brass

[Brass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass) being an alloy can have varying percentages of each metal that makes up the alloy, for the purposes of determining the value of a Brass Razoo (BRZ) use the values of 66% copper and 34% zinc.
